# Pokemon-statistics

This repository contains the code that answers a number of statistical questions relating to Pokemon and their stats,
such as 'Which types appear the most when only looking at the strongest and weakest Pokemon (based on BST)?' and
'Does the average BST change with Generation?'

Applied methods in this script are: manipulating data with numpy and pandas, visualizing data with matplotlib and seaborn, statistical tests with the Mann-Whitney U test, and fitting with scipy (curve_fit).
